### ADWIN:  ADaptive sliding WINdow algorithm

ADWIN is a change detector and estimator that solves in a well-specified way the problem of tracking the average of a stream of bits or real-valued numbers. 

ADWIN keeps a variable-length window of recently seen items, with the property that the window has the maximal length statistically consistent with the hypothesis “there has been no change in the average value inside the window”. More precisely, an older fragment of the window is dropped if and only if there is enough evidence that its average value differs from that of the rest of the window.

```python
class concept_dirft.adwin.Adwin
 (delta=0.002, max_buckets=5, min_clock=32, min_length_window=10, min_length_sub_window=5)
```
| Parameters: | |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| delta: | Confidence value |
| max_buckets: | Max number of buckets which have same number of original date in one row |
| min_clock | Min number of new data for starting to reduce window and detect change |
| min\_length\_window | Min window's length for starting to reduce window and detect change |
| min\_length\_sub\_window | Min sub window's length for starting to reduce window and detect change |

**Methods**

```python
set_input(value)
```
> Set input value to the drift detector - ADWIN.

| Parameters: | |
|-------------|------|
| Value: | Input value |

| Return: | |
|-------------|------|
| Boolean | Whether has drift |

**Example**

```python
from concept_dirft.adwin import Adwin

adwin = Adwin()
for i in range(1000):
    if adwin.set_input(i):
	print("Here is a drift")
```

### Test
 Used the **elecNormNew** dataset;<br>
 Used **GaussianNB** as based classification;<br>
 Used **accuracy_score** as input date for change detector;<br>
 Used the **prequential** evaluation;

GaussianNB :
Mean acc within the window 1000: 0.7289912189511405

ADWIN :
Drift detection: 139
